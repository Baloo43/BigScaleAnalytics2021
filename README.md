### üïµÔ∏è Project Description

<p align="justify"> 
**To improve one‚Äôs skills in a new foreign language, it is important to read texts in that language.** But in order to make learning really effective, these text have to be at the reader‚Äôs language level. However, it is difficult to find texts that are close to someone‚Äôs knowledge level (A1 to C2).

This project aims to build a model for English speakers that **predicts the difficulty of a French written text**. This can be then used, e.g., in a recommendation system, to recommend texts that are appropriate for someone‚Äôs language level. If someone is at A1 French level, it is inappropriate to present a text at B2 level, as she won‚Äôt be able to understand it. Ideally, a text should have many known words and may have a few words that are unknown so that the person can improve.
